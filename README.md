# Welcome to Milford Hacks
## About Us
We are a group of students from Milford who participate in Hackathons and do our own coding.

## Our Projects
### 2017 Hackathon
Recently we completed a 2017 Hackathon, CincyHacks. Our project was an RPG endless dungeon crawler called [REN](https://milfordhacks.github.io/REN/index.html) and you can see our code [here](https://github.com/MilfordHacks/REN/).
Our last changes prior to the end of the Hackathon can be seen [here](https://github.com/MilfordHacks/REN/tree/c105bc4ef59b2cff85f2fee2a1c01f9aa4f7257c)
